# Note

- Swiggy Does Change its API regularly so errors may occure specially when you will see the Restaurent Menu  due to changes in their api.. 
- If you really want to check the Restaurent Menu please go to - MenuURL in the util/constants and add the ResId at the end of url and paste it in the browser from where you will see the api and edit in the Restaurent Menu Lines 14 and 12. 
- I will be fixing the issue whenever i will open the project and add some new more functionality and features in the app wherever possible
